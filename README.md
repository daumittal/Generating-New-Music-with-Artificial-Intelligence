# Generating-New-Music-with-Artificial-Intelligence
In this project, I aim to combine my technical expertise with a creative approach to craft unique music using pretrained AI frameworks. Leveraging Python programming, I will develop interactive applications that allow users to input text-based descriptions (prompts) of musical styles and instruments, enabling the generation of AI-composed music tailored to these inputs. By experimenting with various prompts, I intend to unravel how AI models interpret and translate text into musical compositions.

I will also explore GUI programming and event handling to design an intuitive user interface for music generation. This interface will feature text boxes and buttons, facilitating seamless interaction with the AI-driven music creation functions. As part of this journey, I plan to delve into how prompts influence the quality and diversity of AI-generated music, deepening my understanding of the relationship between prompt engineering and musical outcomes.

Finally, I will analyze and compare the outputs generated by different prompts, highlighting the subtle yet significant effects of prompt selection on the AI music generation process. Through this hands-on exploration, I aim to uncover valuable insights into AI’s potential in music composition and the art of guiding its creativity through effective prompts.
